Technical Info
==============


Web Application
---------------

This is a Rust application, source is in the ``builtonbits`` folder.

Rust was chosen for it's strong typing, performance, lean footprint, and fascination with the language.

GUI Code
--------

This is an plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript Stack.

These tools have a come a long way in the last 10 years and I no longer see the point of adding the pain of frameworks. You get so much out of the box! Let's just use what's there.

Build Tools
-----------

This project is 'tooling light' - there's not much to running it since we're not using much more than built in features of the languages.
